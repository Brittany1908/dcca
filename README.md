The DC Court of Appeals releases [precedential opinions](http://www.dccourts.gov/internet/opinionlocator.jsf) every Thursday morning. [CourtListener](http://courtlistener.com) has 12K+ precedential opinions on its site: <https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&order_by=dateFiled+desc&court=dc&stat_Precedential=on>

But the most recent case is from June 2012, which means that the powerful alert features (native and used by sites like [Scout](https://scout.sunlightfoundation.com)) are unavailable. 

Goal is to use the CourtListener [scraper framework](https://bitbucket.org/mlissner/juriscraper/) to get the DC Court of Appeals fully plugged in.
